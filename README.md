# Task-List
A simple Javascript based To-Do list in which a user can add and delete a task. Along with this the tasks once added will persist in the app once the user closes the window because the data gets stored in the browser's LocalStorage everytime we add one.  I have used PWA concept in this so it can be directly accessed from your home screen just like a Standalone Native Mobile App.
